# Shiritai/sanity-gravity - The Antigravity Sandbox - GitHub
Source URL: https://github.com/Shiritai/sanity-gravity

Source Type: web_page

Source ID: 8503fce8-a4a4-4d80-b78a-5a613ff0a618


A containerized sandbox for Agentic AI — full desktop, headless CLI, or SSH-only, in seconds.
- Docker & Docker Compose (v2.0+)
- Python 3.7+
- Tested on: Ubuntu (amd64/arm64), macOS (Apple Silicon)
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/shiritai/sanity-gravity.git
cd sanity-gravity
# 2. Build the images (one-time)
./sanity-cli build
# 3. Launch the recommended sandbox
./sanity-cli up -v ag-xfce-kasm --password mysecret
Open https://localhost:8444 — your sandboxed desktop is ready!
- Username: your host OS username
- Password:
mysecret
(default:antigravity
)
The self-signed certificate warning on localhost is expected. Click through it.
AI agents run arbitrary code. One rogue rm -rf /
and your host is toast. Sanity-Gravity confines every agent action inside a disposable Docker container while streaming a full desktop experience to your browser — or providing just a minimal SSH shell when that's all you need.
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Host Isolation | Even if an agent runs rm -rf / or downloads malware, only the sandbox is destroyed. Your host stays untouched. |
| Full GUI Desktop | Ubuntu 24.04 + XFCE4 + KasmVNC. Agents operate browsers and GUI apps just like a human would. |
| Headless CLI Agents | Minimal images for Gemini CLI and Claude Code — no desktop overhead, just SSH. |
| Out-of-the-Box | Pre-installed with Antigravity IDE, Google Chrome, and Git. Zero setup time. |
| Seamless Disk I/O | Smart UID/GID mapping. No root-owned file disasters after host volume mounts. |
| Multi-Instance | Parallel isolated sandboxes. Host ports are auto-allocated when unspecified (zero conflicts), or can be set manually. |
| Container Snapshots | Freeze your configured environment (installed software, active logins) into a new image branch. |
| IDE Safe Upgrade | Built-in dpkg-divert protection prevents apt upgrade from breaking Antigravity or Chrome. |
| SSH Agent Proxy | Use host SSH keys inside containers — no private key copying required. |
| Multi-Arch | All images support both amd64 and arm64 . |
Every image is described by a tag: {agent}-{desktop}-{connector}
. Pick one that matches your use case:
| I want to... | Tag | Connect via |
|---|---|---|
| Run Antigravity IDE in browser | ag-xfce-kasm |
https://localhost:8444 |
| Run Antigravity IDE via VNC | ag-xfce-vnc |
localhost:5901 |
| Use Gemini CLI in a terminal | gc-none-ssh |
ssh -p 2222 ... |
| Use Gemini CLI with a desktop | gc-xfce-kasm |
https://localhost:8444 |
| Use Claude Code in a terminal | cc-none-ssh |
ssh -p 2222 ... |
| Use Claude Code with a desktop | cc-xfce-kasm |
https://localhost:8444 |
First time? Start with
ag-xfce-kasm
— it gives you the full desktop experience via your browser.
There are 11 valid combinations in total. See Modular Tag System for the full matrix, dimension model, and constraint rules.
./sanity-cli up -v <tag> # Start a sandbox
--password <pwd> # SSH/VNC password (default: antigravity)
--workspace <path> # Host directory to mount (default: ./workspace)
--name <name> # Project name for multi-instance (default: sanity-gravity)
--cpus <n> --memory <n> # Resource limits (e.g. --cpus 2 --memory 4G)
--image <img> # Use a snapshot image instead of the default
./sanity-cli down # Stop and remove containers
./sanity-cli stop / start # Pause / resume
./sanity-cli restart # Force restart
./sanity-cli clean # Deep cleanup: containers, volumes, and local images
./sanity-cli status # Show running instances
./sanity-cli shell # Drop into container shell (zsh, fallback to bash)
--use {zsh,bash} # Pick shell explicitly (disables fallback)
./sanity-cli open # Open web desktop in browser
./sanity-cli build [tag...] # Build images (default: all)
--no-cache # Disable Docker layer cache
./sanity-cli list # Show all valid tags
./sanity-cli list --json # JSON output (for CI matrix)
./sanity-cli check # Verify Docker prerequisites

Sanity-Gravity provides a robust defense mechanism against accidental IDE or browser uninstallation caused by apt upgrade
.
- Host side:
sanity-cli
manages container lifecycles. Maintenance commands auto-inject the latest protection script into the target container, ensuring backward compatibility with legacy snapshots. - Container side:
gravity-cli
(built-in) safely manages Antigravity IDE and Google Chrome viadpkg-divert
, guaranteeing their--no-sandbox
privilege protections survive system updates.
# Safely update IDE to the latest package version
./sanity-cli ide update --name sanity-gravity
# Nuclear option: full wipe + clean reinstall to fix persistent crashes
./sanity-cli ide reinstall --name sanity-gravity
sudo gravity-cli update-ide # Equivalent to 'ide update'
sudo gravity-cli reinstall-ide # Equivalent to 'ide reinstall'
A built-in proxy bridges your host's SSH Agent Socket into the container. This enables git push
/ git pull
inside the sandbox using your host's private keys — without ever copying them.
./sanity-cli up
handles this automatically. For manual control:
./sanity-cli proxy status # Check proxy and active connections
./sanity-cli proxy setup # Restart / fix proxy
./sanity-cli proxy remove # Terminate proxy
Run unlimited parallel sandboxes using --name
:
# Launch a second instance
./sanity-cli up -v ag-xfce-kasm --name dev-02 --workspace /tmp/dev02
Zero-Conflict Guarantee: sanity-cli
auto-allocates free host ports when using a custom name. Check your assigned ports via ./sanity-cli status
. Target a specific instance with --name
(e.g. ./sanity-cli down --name dev-02
).
Freeze your configured environment — installed software, login sessions, custom settings — into a reusable image.
-
Create a snapshot:
./sanity-cli snapshot --name my-base-env --tag my-verified-state:v1
-
Launch from the snapshot:
./sanity-cli up -v ag-xfce-kasm --name new-experiment --image my-verified-state:v1
All images — including GUI variants — expose SSH on port 2222
by default. This enables:
- Headless automation — script tasks from the host without opening a desktop
- Port forwarding —
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 -p 2222 $USER@localhost
- Remote development — VS Code Remote SSH, JetBrains Gateway
ssh -p 2222 $USER@localhost

"Sanity-Gravity" — providing a strong Gravity (constraints) in the unpredictable world of Antigravity (AI agents), to preserve the developer's Sanity.
By confining unvetted AI execution to disposable containers, we eliminate irreversible damage: accidental file deletion, credential hijacking, configuration pollution.
